# Simple Logic Simplifier

A simple logic simplifier that outputs simplified Boolean logic expressions from the input truth table.

Supports the processing of irrelevant terms, the algorithm idea comes from Quine-McCluskey algorithm.

This is my data structures course design. Due to my limited level, I take a more complex implementation, such as the use of a large number of recursion, and the program may contain errors. Welcome to correct it.
